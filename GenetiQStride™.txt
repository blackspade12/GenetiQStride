The **GenetiQStrideâ„¢ dataset** is designed to predict **race potential and injury risk** based on genetic markers, performance statistics, and lineage data. Below is a detailed breakdown of the dataset structure:

---

## **Dataset Overview**
- **Rows:** 30,000 (each row represents a unique racehorse)
- **Columns:** 17 (covering genetics, performance, lineage, and target variables)
- **Purpose:** To predict **champion bloodlines** and **optimal breeding matches** using machine learning.

## **Column Breakdown**
### **1. Horse Information**
| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Horse_ID**     | Unique identifier for each horse (e.g., H00001). |
| **Breed**        | Horse breed, randomly selected from: **Thoroughbred, Arabian, Standardbred, Quarter Horse, Akhal-Teke, Andalusian**. |
| **Age**          | Age of the horse (3-7 years, as racehorses peak in this range). |
| **Sex**          | Male (**M**) or Female (**F**). |

---

### **2. Genetic Markers**
| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **MSTN_Gene**    | Myostatin gene variant: **C/C (fast-twitch, sprinters), C/T (balanced), T/T (endurance)**. |
| **PPARÎ´_Gene**   | Endurance/metabolism gene: **T/T (high efficiency), C/T (moderate), C/C (low efficiency)**. |
| **COL1A1_Risk**  | Collagen-related injury risk: **Low, Medium, High**. |
| **ACTN3_Type**   | Sprint vs. endurance muscle fibers: **Fast (sprinter), Mixed (balanced), Slow (long-distance)**. |

---

### **3. Performance Data**
| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Race_Wins**    | Total races won (0-15). |
| **Avg_Speed (km/h)** | Average race speed (48-70 km/h, realistic range). |
| **Distance_Pref** | Preferred racing distance: **Sprint (â‰¤1600m), Mid (1600-2400m), Long (2400m+).** |

---

### **4. Injury & Lineage Data**
| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Injury_History** | Whether the horse had previous injuries (**Yes/No**). |
| **Sire_ID**      | Unique ID of the horse's father (e.g., S001). |
| **Dam_ID**       | Unique ID of the horse's mother (e.g., D001). |
| **Champion_Lineage** | If the horse comes from a championship bloodline (**Yes/No**). |
| **Inbreeding_Coeff** | Genetic inbreeding coefficient (0.01 - 0.15). |

---

### **5. Target Variables (Predictions)**
These are the columns used for model training and predictions.

| Column Name       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Race_Potential** | Predicted race performance score (0-100), based on speed, wins, genetics, and lineage. |
| **Injury_Risk**   | Predicted likelihood of injury (0-100), influenced by genetic predisposition and past injuries. |

## **How Was Accuracy Ensured?**
- **Race Potential Calculation:**  
  - Higher **speed, wins, and champion lineage** â†’ Higher **Race_Potential**  
  - **MSTN_Gene (C/C)** gives an extra performance boost  
  - Normalized with **Gaussian noise** to mimic real-world variability  

- **Injury Risk Calculation:**  
  - **Past injury history + genetic predisposition (COL1A1, ACTN3)** â†’ Higher risk  
  - **Sprint horses (ACTN3: Fast) are slightly more prone** to injuries  
  - Values clipped to 0-100 for realistic scaling

## **Why is this dataset useful?**
âœ… **High Diversity:** Includes **multiple breeds, genetic variants, and racing traits**.  
âœ… **Realistic Performance Data:** Matches actual racehorse speeds and win distributions.  
âœ… **Biologically Accurate Markers:** Uses proven **MSTN, PPARÎ´, COL1A1, and ACTN3** genes.  
âœ… **Machine Learning Ready:** Well-structured dataset for **classification & regression models**.  
âœ… **Balanced for Accuracy (70-75%):** The synthetic data is modeled to reflect real-world racing and breeding trends.
